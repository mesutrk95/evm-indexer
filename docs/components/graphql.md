# ðŸ”Œ GraphQL

To fetch data for your dApp, SolidQL provides a **single GraphQL endpoint**. It's an easy way to ask for decentralized data from your contracts. You can use either the GraphiQL interface or your preferred GraphQL client to query your contract data.

\
For example, if you're working with ReactJS, you can easily use the **React Apollo Client**, which is accessible [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@apollo/client).

#### Note

GraphiQL, as a GraphQL client, will be accessible at the following address:

[http://localhost:8000/graphql](http://localhost:8000/graphql)
{% endhint %}
